I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to use Cloud Functions, but have found them extrodinarily frustrating.
My problems are:
Slow feedback loop Slow feedback loops kill a dev&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness&amp;hellip; when deploying a new cloud function, it takes â‰ˆ 30-40 seconds before one knows if something has failed - this is a long time to get feedback on a change One really can&amp;rsquo;t reasonably use cloud functions in the GUI - one would have to develop and test locally to make any workflow possible A ton of clicking just to see what has gone wrong If something does go wrong, (after waiting the 30-40 seconds to see that it has failed), one then has to click through a number of tabs/pages to view the logs&amp;hellip; this is really frustrating for devs who are used to not having to take their hands off the keyboard Odd UX when deploy fails When a deploy fails and one tries to edit the function, one will find that the function is not the most recent version of the function&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s the previously deployed version of the function!</description></item></channel></rss>
