&lt;p>The smith of the gods is lame.
His feet have seen no battles.
His legs have won no races.
The smith of the gods is lame.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The smith of the gods is lame.
His hands have won more battles than any other man,
for tho his feet not bring him glory, his skill, his hands have stood.
The smith of the gods is lame.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The smith of the gods is lame.
His hands have made more weapons
than armories can handle.
The smith of the gods is lame.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
