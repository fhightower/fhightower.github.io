&lt;p>As I&amp;rsquo;m exploring machine learning, I have found it helpful to have a simple game I can use as a context in which to test ideas.
This blog post describes one such game.
I call it &amp;ldquo;Simplex&amp;rdquo;. The game is trivially simple, but can be extended to make it more challenging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The game works as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There are two players (&amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;b&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each player gets only one move which is made simultaneously with the other player&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each player has one marble&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each marble weighs one unit&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For each move, players choose how many marbles to place on his/her side of a scale&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The winner is the player with the most weight on their side of the scale&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can read, run, and edit an implementation of this game in Clojure (and Python) &lt;a href="https://nextjournal.com/fhightower/scale-game-part-1">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In future posts, I&amp;rsquo;ll examine:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Different approaches to playing this game (including machine learning strategies)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How these approaches change when the game changes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
