Spanner Horizontally scalable No-ops Only change needed is to add nodes Add another node if CPU &amp;gt; 70-75% Each node can handle 1.5 - 2 TB Can create linked/embeded tables Helps avoid the cost of joins for normalized tables Two payment methods: Pay-by-node: standard method Pay-by-processing-unit: let&amp;rsquo;s you pay for more granular operations/scale 1 node = 1,000 processing units</description></item></channel></rss>
