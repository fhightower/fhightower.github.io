&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We can represent every natural number as the sum of, at most, four squares.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For example, we can represent 27 as:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>16 + 9 + 1 + 1
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>or&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>4^2 + 3^3 + 1^2 + 1^2
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>As I was reading about this, I came up with the following conjecture. This conjecture may already exist (I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked into the subject yet) or it may be false. From a cursory analysis, it seems to hold true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My conjecture is:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We can represent every natural number as the sum of, at most, n n-sided numbers.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I need to formalize what I mean by &amp;ldquo;n-sided number&amp;rdquo;, but intuitively, I mean that, when n=3, n-sided numbers are triangular numbers; when n=4, we are dealing with square numbers; n=5 means pentagonal numbers; etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I plan to do some research in the future to see if this already exists and, if not, how I might go about proving it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
