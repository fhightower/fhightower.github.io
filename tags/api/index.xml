I found my self saying &amp;ldquo;UI&amp;rdquo; (which is short for &amp;ldquo;User Interface&amp;rdquo;) to describe a &amp;ldquo;GUI&amp;rdquo; (a &amp;ldquo;Graphical User Interface&amp;rdquo;). UI is a broad category which encompasses multiple ways a user may interface with a system. A GUI is a specific instance of UI which relies on &amp;lsquo;visual metaphors&amp;rsquo; to communicate information to a user and allow the user to interact with the underlying system (the most ubiquitous example of a GUI is a website).&lt;/p>

&lt;/aside>
&lt;p>When I use &amp;lsquo;UI&amp;rsquo; to describe a GUI, I&amp;rsquo;m limiting the definition of UI only to GUIs.&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> Shrinking the definition of UI is dangerous because it makes it easy for us to forget about all of the other ways users interface with a system. A CLI (Command Line Interface) or API (Application Programming Interface) is just as much a UI as a GUI. All interfaces with a system should be as user-friendly as possible and the first step to accomplish this is to recognize all of the ways a user interfaces with a system.&lt;/p>
