I believe that doing things of great value takes time. This applies to software, research, education, business, relationships, sports, and every area of life. I experience this reality on a daily basis as my passion is writing software. Good software and powerful tools just take time to design, develop, and refine.</description></item><item><title>Let Your Ideas See the Light of Day</title><link>https://hightower.space/posts/light-of-day/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hightower.space/posts/light-of-day/</guid><description>It is a deeply held principle of mine that beliefs and ideas are strongest when they have been tested and exposed to the proverbial &amp;rsquo;light of day&amp;rsquo;. We have a tendency to cloister our beliefs and new ideas within the comfortable walls of our own minds. When we do this, we are missing out on the criticism, critique, and dialog that makes ideas powerful and robust.
Ideas which are not exposed to the real world are like a cardboard box; they can withstand minimal pressure from certain directions, but are not ready to hold up the weight of careful scrutiny.</description></item></channel></rss>
