To accomplish this, I started looking into ZeroMQ. ZeroMQ is amazing! It is very well-structured and generalizes the problem of messaging between machines very effectively.
While the ZeroMQ documentation is extensive, it is easy (at least for me) to get lost in the docs and forget the simplicity and elegance of ZeroMQ.</description></item><item><title>Domain Squatting Math</title><link>https://hightower.space/posts/math-behind-domain-squatting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hightower.space/posts/math-behind-domain-squatting/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it &amp;hellip; he who doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;hellip; pays it.&amp;rdquo;
― Albert Einstein
What is domain squatting? Domain squatting is when someone registers a domain name which looks like another domain name. Usually, the term &amp;ldquo;domain squatting&amp;rdquo; is used in a context where malicious intent is implied. For example, someone trying to steal passwords may register the domain name gooogle.</description></item><item><title>Conjecture on Resource Utilization</title><link>https://hightower.space/posts/resource-utilization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hightower.space/posts/resource-utilization/</guid><description>We fifty-four were the masters of England!

pragmaticism (prag-mat′ i-sizm), n.

I found my self saying &amp;ldquo;UI&amp;rdquo; (which is short for &amp;ldquo;User Interface&amp;rdquo;) to describe a &amp;ldquo;GUI&amp;rdquo; (a &amp;ldquo;Graphical User Interface&amp;rdquo;). UI is a broad category which encompasses multiple ways a user may interface with a system. A GUI is a specific instance of UI which relies on &amp;lsquo;visual metaphors&amp;rsquo; to communicate information to a user and allow the user to interact with the underlying system (the most ubiquitous example of a GUI is a website).</description></item><item><title>Words</title><link>https://hightower.space/posts/my-words/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hightower.space/posts/my-words/</guid><description>The words we use open doors for us to think new thoughts. Personally, I agree with a weak hypothesis branch of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis as supported by the &amp;ldquo;Russian blues&amp;rdquo; experiment.

We have a tendency to cloister our beliefs and new ideas within the comfortable walls of our own minds. When we do this, we are missing out on the criticism, critique, and dialog that makes ideas powerful and robust.
Ideas which are not exposed to the real world are like a cardboard box; they can withstand minimal pressure from certain directions, but are not ready to hold up the weight of careful scrutiny.</description></item><item><title>ThreatConnect DoubleCheck</title><link>https://hightower.space/projects/tc-dc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hightower.space/projects/tc-dc/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Programmable Logic Controller Projects</title><link>https://hightower.space/projects/plc-projects/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hightower.space/projects/plc-projects/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Idyll Lang Sublime Text Snippets</title><link>https://hightower.space/projects/idyll-lang-sublime-snippets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hightower.space/projects/idyll-lang-sublime-snippets/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Playbook Documenter</title><link>https://hightower.space/projects/playbook-documenter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hightower.space/projects/playbook-documenter/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Indicator of Compromise Utility Library</title><link>https://hightower.space/projects/ioc-utility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hightower.space/projects/ioc-utility/</guid><description>Documentation The following functions are currently available:

I am arguing, however, that this definition has changed with the advent of professional sports. With the rise of professional baseball and football in the first third of the 20th century, people began to view sports as an important part of culture.</description></item><item><title>The Smith of the gods is Lame</title><link>https://hightower.space/posts/the-smith-of-the-gods-is-lame/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hightower.space/posts/the-smith-of-the-gods-is-lame/</guid><description>The Smith of the gods is Lame The smith of the gods is lame.
