<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws</em></td>
<td>John R. Lott Jr.</td>

<td>Insightful work presenting numerous statistics showing, as the title implies, that the more guns possessed by private citizens, the less crime is likely to occur in a given area</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Out of the Silent Planet</em></td>
<td>C. S. Lewis</td>
<td>B+</td>
<td>Amazing work of science fiction (which certainly is influenced by and is a spin on H. G. Wells' <em>War of the Worlds</em>) pondering the interaction of a fallen man with unfallen creatures on Malacandra</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>The Abolition of Man</em></td>
<td>C. S. Lewis</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>An amazing work critiquing moral subjectivism - I think he is, at times, oversimplifying his opponents' views and oversimplifying the evidence in favor of his own, but still think it is a thought-provoking read</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>A Gospel Primer for Christians: Learning to See the Glories of God&rsquo;s Love</em></td>
<td>Milton Vincent</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>Very good work celebrating (and encouraging us to daily celebrate), in various forms and genres, the beauty of God the Father&rsquo;s love for us as shown in the Son, Jesus Christ, and mediated by the Holy Spirit.</td>

<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em></td>
<td>C. S. Lewis</td>
<td>B+</td>
<td>Fantastic read (as always with Lewis). &ldquo;Peter held the door closed but did not shut it; for, of course, he remembered, as every sensible person does, that you should never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe.&rdquo;</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em></td>
<td>Robert A. Heinlein</td>
<td>A</td>

<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>The Wrong Shape</em></td>
<td>G. K. Chesteron</td>
<td>D</td>
<td>Perhaps I missed an underlying theme of this work (I did listen to it while otherwise occupied), but I did not find this to be one of GK&rsquo;s better works.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Prince Caspian</em></td>
<td>C. S. Lewis</td>
<td>C-</td>
<td>Not one of Lewis' better works. I appreciated it a bit more this time, but still feels rushed and hastily written.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Whose Body?</em></td>
<td>Dorothy L. Sayers</td>
<td>C+</td>
<td>Not bad as far as murder mysteries are concerned.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Unnatural Death</em> (see above)</td>

<tr>
<td><em>Cloud of Witnesses</em> (see above)</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>The Necessity of Reforming the Church</em></td>
<td>John Calvin</td>
<td>B-</td>
<td>Good work presenting the complaints of the reformers against the Roman Catholic Church. Interesting to hear the complaints in their own words and fascinating how much John Calvin quotes from the church fathers.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Little Book on the Christian Life</em></td>
<td>John Calvin</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>Very good book. Recommended for Christians.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Five Red Herrings</em></td>

<td>B</td>
<td>Very fun and tantalizing read. Enjoyed this one more than some of the others.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Desiring the Kingdom: Worship, Worldview, and Cultural Formation (Cultural Liturgies)</em></td>
<td>James K. A. Smith</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>Fantastic read highly recommended for Christian scholars. He, appropriately I believe, addresses the overly rationalistic mentality that is common in the conservative, evangelical church today. I appreciate his focus on the value and import of daily, &lsquo;common&rsquo; practices (read &lsquo;liturgies&rsquo;) that are shaping us.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>NutureShock: New Thinking About Children</em></td>
<td>Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>Insightful book providing recent research about raising children.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Last Days According to Jesus</em></td>
<td>R. C. Sproul</td>
<td>B+</td>
<td>Very approachable and comprehensible overview of eschatology (with a focus on the partial, preterite view).</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>The ZDoggMD Show</em></td>
<td>ZDogg</td>
<td>A+</td>
<td>Not a book, but a very <em>highly</em> recommended <a href=https://zdoggmd.com/podcasts/>podcast</a> in which ZDogg investigates various aspects of medicine. He does a better job than anybody I know at communicating nuance and complexity of things like the covid vaccine and whether or not masks do anything helpful. If there&rsquo;s one thing you take away from this list, it&rsquo;s to read some C. S. Lewis. Second to that is listen to this podcast :)</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Civilization and Its Discontents</em></td>
<td>Sigmund Freud</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>Sometimes thinkers appeal to what they perceive is a general consensus to prove their point which I do not share. I find Freud does this a bit. I agree with Freud&rsquo;s own comments late in the book viz that the work is, at times rambling. Perhaps I lack the taste necessary to appreciate Freud or maybe this is not one of his great works, but I found it disappointing for someone so highly regarded and oft cited as Freud.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>No-Drama Discipline: The Whole-Brain Way to Calm the Chaos and Nurture Your Child&rsquo;s Developing Mind</em></td>
<td>Daniel J. J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson</td>
<td>C+</td>
<td>Good book w/ helpful principles for disciplining children. I appreciate the emphasis on <strong>connecting</strong> with kids and <strong>redirecting</strong> them toward better behaviours rather than flying off the handle in spur-of-the-moment frustration.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Expecting Better: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom Is Wrong&ndash;and What You Really Need to Know</em></td>
<td>Emily Oster</td>
<td>A+</td>
<td>Valuable book applying an evidence-driven approach to conception, pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Very informative and thorough in both depth and breadth.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave</em></td>
<td>Frederick Douglass</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>This is an powerful and compelling narrative describing the horrors and inner workings of slavery. Also, a powerful indictment of the kind of religion which was complicit in slavery. &ldquo;I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of the land&mldr; The dealers in the bodies of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit, and they mutually help each other. The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his infernal business with the garb of Christianity. Here we have religion and robbery the allies of each other—devils dressed in angels’ robes, and hell presenting the semblance of paradise.&rdquo;</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions</em></td>
<td>Edwin Abbott</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>Funny and fascinating read. It is funny as a critique and commentary of Abbott&rsquo;s victorian society and fascinating to consider what a two dimensional world would be like and the complexities of moving from one dimension to another in either reality or imagination.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>He Saw That It Was Good: Reimagining Your Creative Life to Repair a Broken World</em></td>
<td>Sho Baraka</td>
<td>C+</td>
<td>I still do not know what I think this book. I recommend it and there is some great, thought provoking content therein. I am saddened and confused by an attitude in the book that seems to say (and I sincerely hope I&rsquo;m not misrepresenting the book) that Christians of different ethnicities should be separate so they don&rsquo;t lose their cultural identities and creative resources. While I whole-heartedly support the preservation of cultural identities and creative resources, I also believe that a Church can be ethnically and culturally diverse without eclipsing many of the constituent ethnicities (although, I grant, this is rarely accomplished). I could have misunderstood Sho Baraka, but I understood him as advocating for christians of different ethnicies to remain relatively distinct and I do not see that as a desirable goal.</td>
<td></td>

<td><em>The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse</em></td>
<td>Charlie Mackesy</td>
<td>A+</td>
<td>&ldquo;What do you want to be when you grow up?&rdquo; &ldquo;Kind&rdquo; said the boy.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Replacing Darwin: The New Origin of Species</em></td>
<td>Nathaniel T Jeanson</td>
<td>C+</td>
<td>Interesting book. The first bit (half?) is introductory biology and genetics (both history and theory). The second half of the book makes the argument that speciation occurs rather rapidly (one new species every couple of years) and that &ldquo;shifts from heterozygosity to homozygosity are the major genetic mechanism of speciation&rdquo;.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth</em></td>
<td>Edward O. Wilson</td>
<td>C+</td>
<td>Good book, written by a secular humanist scientist to a hypothetical pastor, presenting the case for preserving the created world. As the author expresses, I find it fascinating that Christians who believe God created the world have bought into political ideologies (the current, Republican mantra) which treats our planet with very little dignity.</td>
<td></td>

<td>Beautiful collection of creative and imaginative photos!</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation</em></td>
<td>Bill Nye</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>Neither Bill Nye nor Ken Ham (a creationist Bill Nye debated which prompted this book) are very nuanced in their views and they both overstate their position. For example, Bill overstates the advantage and evolutionary world-view holds over a creationist view with respect to the joy of discovery and exploring the world around us. Both the evolutionist and creationist can passionately explore the world around us. Bill does raise some good objections to Ken Ham&rsquo;s distinction between &lsquo;historic&rsquo; science and &lsquo;present&rsquo; science (as he did in the debate). I will say, Bill Nye&rsquo;s rebuttle to the creationist objection that evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics by requiring that order come from energy released in a closed system was very poor. He objects that earth is <em>not</em> a closed system because it gets energy from the universe around it. This ignores the fact that the argument still works if one just expands the objection to the universe. In other words: granted that the earth isn&rsquo;t a closed system, but the <em>universe</em> is, so the same problem applies. Why is there order in the universe if, according to an evolutionary worldview, the universe is a closed system into which energy is released.</td>

The notation is simple and powerful but be warned: once you get the hang of it, you&rsquo;ll start seeing and describing symmetries everywhere! Part three was beyond my current abilities, but still worth skimming for the beautiful diagrams.</td>
