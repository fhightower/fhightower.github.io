He, appropriately I believe, addresses the overly rationalistic mentality that is common in the conservative, evangelical church today.

    - "Not a book, but a very *highly* recommended [podcast](https://zdoggmd.com/podcasts/) in which ZDogg investigates various aspects of medicine. He does a better job than anybody I know at communicating nuance and complexity of things like the covid vaccine and whether or not masks do anything helpful. If there's one thing you take away from this list, it's to read some C. S. Lewis. Second to that is listen to this podcast :)"

  authors:
    - "Sigmund Freud"
  rating: C
  notes:
    - "Sometimes thinkers appeal to what they perceive is a general consensus to prove their point which I do not share. I find Freud does this a bit. I agree with Freud's own comments late in the book viz that the work is, at times rambling. Perhaps I lack the taste necessary to appreciate Freud or maybe this is not one of his great works, but I found it disappointing for someone so highly regarded and oft cited as Freud."

  authors:
    - "Frederick Douglass"
  rating: A
  notes:
    - "This is an powerful and compelling narrative describing the horrors and inner workings of slavery. Also, a powerful indictment of the kind of religion which was complicit in slavery."
    - "I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of the land... The dealers in the bodies of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit, and they mutually help each other. The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his infernal business with the garb of Christianity. Here we have religion and robbery the allies of each other—devils dressed in angels’ robes, and hell presenting the semblance of paradise."
- title: "*Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions*"
  authors:
    - "Edwin Abbott"
  rating: B
  notes:
    - "Funny and fascinating read. It is funny as a critique and commentary of Abbott's victorian society and fascinating to consider what a two dimensional world would be like and the complexities of moving from one dimension to another in either reality or imagination."
- title: "*He Saw That It Was Good: Reimagining Your Creative Life to Repair a Broken World*"
  authors:
    - "Sho Baraka"
  rating: C+
  notes:
    - "I still do not know what I think this book. I recommend it and there is some great, thought provoking content therein. I am saddened and confused by an attitude in the book that seems to say (and I sincerely hope I'm not misrepresenting the book) that Christians of different ethnicities should be separate so they don't lose their cultural identities and creative resources. While I whole-heartedly support the preservation of cultural identities and creative resources, I also believe that a Church can be ethnically and culturally diverse without eclipsing many of the constituent ethnicities (although, I grant, this is rarely accomplished). I could have misunderstood Sho Baraka, but I understood him as advocating for christians of different ethnicies to remain relatively distinct and I do not see that as a desirable goal."

  authors:
    - "Bill Nye"
  rating: C
  notes:
    - "Neither Bill Nye nor Ken Ham (a creationist Bill Nye debated which prompted this book) are very nuanced in their views and they both overstate their position. For example, Bill overstates the advantage and evolutionary world-view holds over a creationist view with respect to the joy of discovery and exploring the world around us. Both the evolutionist and creationist can passionately explore the world around us. Bill does raise some good objections to Ken Ham's distinction between 'historic' science and 'present' science (as he did in the debate). I will say, Bill Nye's rebuttle to the creationist objection that evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics by requiring that order come from energy released in a closed system was very poor. He objects that earth is *not* a closed system because it gets energy from the universe around it. This ignores the fact that the argument still works if one just expands the objection to the universe. In other words: granted that the earth isn't a closed system, but the *universe* is, so the same problem applies. Why is there order in the universe if, according to an evolutionary worldview, the universe is a closed system into which energy is released."
