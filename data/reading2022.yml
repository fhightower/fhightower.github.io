  rating: "A"
  notes:
    - "I enjoy this series more and more each time I read it."
    - "This time, I noticed how the adventure begins right in Hobbiton as Frodo is almost caught on a number of occasions. The movies scale the danger as the adventure goes on, but the books introduce the danger right from the start"

  authors:
    - "Vern S. Poythress"
  rating: "C"
  notes:
    - "Mildly interesting"
    - "At times, the arguments seem overly simple, obvious, or forced. For example, the author argues that our ability to extrapolate natural numbers to infinity shows how we are thinking God's thoughts after Him and imitating (in a small way) God's infinitude. While this may be true, I don't *feel* the weight/value of this argument."

    - "I felt all positions were very clearly articulated"
    - "My agreement w/ the various views (from greatest to least) is: 1. Spiritual Continuity, 2. Moderate Discontinuity, 3. Eschatological Continuity, 4. Strong Discontinuity"
    - "I was particularly interested by C. S. Cowles argument and responses. His response to Tremper Longman was interesting in that he seemed (like Job's friends) to be saying 'The book of Revelation is complicated... here's what it means...'. Additionally, his quotation of Exodus 34:6-7 (pg. 195) was interesting b/c he cut the quotation short so that it didn't include God's promise to punish the guilty and punish evil-doers and their children."

    - "As stated in the conclusion of this book: '[T]his book has argued that we can hope to effect live-giving social reforms through work'"
    - "As stated in the conclusion of this book: 'This book maintains that despite human sin, the cultural mandate... still stands. We dare to think that Christians can do more than making a living or avoiding sin. We show that Christ, the King, has come and that His kingdom has arrived, even in our work, in every realm of life.'"

But to keep up with climate change, tree species would have to move about 10 *kilometers* a year! Thus, many farmers are proactively 'helping' tree species move (called 'assisted migration')."

    - "Before reading this book, I would not have considered myself a presuppositional apologist, but after reading it I now do"

    - "Interesting read asserting that Chinese explorers explored and colonized the world around 1421. Although I think some points are a stretch, I think the overall argument is compelling (although I have not read any academic responses to Mr. Menzies' argument)."
    - "One recurring argument of particular interest was the argument that some distortions and errors on early maps can be explained by considering that early explorers were just viewing land from a ship a sea (sometimes are great distances) and, at certain latitudes, would have a hard time finding their longitude (a challenge he discusses at length in the book)."
