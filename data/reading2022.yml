  rating: "C"
  notes:
    - "Mildly interesting"
    - "At times, the arguments seem overly simple, obvious, or forced. For example, the author argues that our ability to extrapolate natural numbers to infinity shows how we are thinking God's thoughts after Him and imitating (in a small way) God's infinitude. While this may be true, I don't *feel* the weight/value of this argument."
