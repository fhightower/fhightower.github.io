  rating: "A"
  notes:
    - "I enjoy this series more and more each time I read it."

- title: "Redeeming Mathematics: A God-Centered Approach"
  authors:
    - "Vern S. Poythress"
  rating: "C"
  notes:
    - "Mildly interesting"
    - "At times, the arguments seem overly simple, obvious, or forced. For example, the author argues that our ability to extrapolate natural numbers to infinity shows how we are thinking God's thoughts after Him and imitating (in a small way) God's infinitude. While this may be true, I don't *feel* the weight/value of this argument."

  rating: "B"
  notes:
    - "I felt all positions were very clearly articulated"
    - "My agreement w/ the various views (from greatest to least) is: 1. Spiritual Continuity, 2. Moderate Discontinuity, 3. Eschatological Continuity, 4. Strong Discontinuity"
    - "I was particularly interested by C. S. Cowles argument and responses. His respone to Tremper Longman was interesting in that he seemed (like Job's friends) to be saying 'The book of Revelation is complicated... here's what it means...'. Additionally, his quotation of Exodus 34:6-7 (pg. 195) was interesting b/c he cut the quotation short so that it didn't include God's promise to punish the guilty and punish evil-doers and their children."

    - "As stated in the conclusion of this book: 'This book maintains that despite human sin, the cultural mandate... still stands. We dare to think that Christians can do more than making a living or avoiding sin. We show that Christ, the King, has come and that His kingdom has arrived, even in our work, in every realm of life.'"
    - "Very good read that addresses some foundational questions about work from a historical, theological, and biblical approach"

But to keep up with climate change, tree species would have to move about 10 *kilometers* a year! Thus, many farmers are proactively 'helping' tree species move (called 'assisted migration')."
