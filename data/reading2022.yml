  rating: "B+"
  notes:
    - "I enjoy this series more and more each time I read it."
    - "This time, I noticed how the adventure begins right in Hobbiton as Frodo is almost caught on a number of occasions. The movies scale the danger as the adventure goes on, but the books introduce the danger right from the start"

- title: "*Redeeming Mathematics: A God-Centered Approach*"
  authors:
    - "Vern S. Poythress"
  rating: "C"
  notes:
    - "Mildly interesting"
    - "At times, the arguments seem overly simple, obvious, or forced. For example, the author argues that our ability to extrapolate natural numbers to infinity shows how we are thinking God's thoughts after Him and imitating (in a small way) God's infinitude. While this may be true, I don't *feel* the weight/value of this argument."
- title: "*Trivium: The Classical Liberal Arts of Grammar, Logic, & Rhetoric*"

- title: "*Husband-Coached Childbirth: The Bradley Method of Natural Childbirth*"
  authors:
    - "Robert A. Bradley"
  rating: "C"
  notes:
    - "This was clearly written at a very different time (e.g. a time when husbands couldn't be in the room w/ their wives)"

    - "While I'm certainly not an expert, he seems to be overstating the ease of unmedicated childbirth"

    - "Tremper Longman III"
    - "Stanley N. Gundry (Editor)"
  rating: "B"
  notes:
    - "I felt all positions were very clearly articulated"
    - "My agreement w/ the various views (from greatest to least) is: 1. Spiritual Continuity, 2. Moderate Discontinuity, 3. Eschatological Continuity, 4. Strong Discontinuity"
    - "I was particularly interested by C. S. Cowles argument and responses. His respone to Tremper Longman was interesting in that he seemed (like Job's friends) to be saying 'The book of Revelation is complicated... here's what it means...'. Additionally, his quotation of Exodus 34:6-7 (pg. 195) was interesting b/c he cut the quotation short so that it didn't include God's promise to punish the guilty and punish evil-doers and their children."

  notes:
    - "As stated in the conclusion of this book: '[T]his book has argued that we can hope to effect live-giving social reforms through work'"
    - "As stated in the conclusion of this book: 'This book maintains that despite human sin, the cultural mandate... still stands. We dare to think that Christians can do more than making a living or avoiding sin. We show that Christ, the King, has come and that His kingdom has arrived, even in our work, in every realm of life.'"
    - "Very good read that addresses some foundational questions about work from a historical, theological, and biblical approach"
