### Principles

#### Life Principles

Here are some of the principles I try apply to every area of my life:

- [Let your ideas see the light of day](/thoughts/light-of-day/)
- Always be willing to accept feedback and criticism (even when it is poorly delivered)
- [Rome ne s'est pas faite en un jour](/thoughts/great-things-take-time/) (Rome wasn't built in a day)
- Don’t be too proud to follow a good example
- Loose ends always unravel
- Unanswered questions never go away
- The Tisroc won’t live forever whether you want him to or not
- Talk less; listen more
- Use more semi-colons
- Use oxford commas
- Learn how to politely say "No"
- Don't let the possibility of failure scare you away from starting something
- To do something, you have to do something
- A whiteboard is worth a thousand laptops
- [Ideas have consequences](https://hightower.space/reading-list/consequences-of-ideas/)

<!-- #### Software Design and Development Principles

When working on a software project, I try to consider and apply the following principles:

- Make the software do the work: software should make life easier (for the end-user)... if it isn't, you're doing something wrong
- Sometimes the best way to start is by writing code that you know will not work
- Simple is better than complex
- Human interaction with a computer should be dynamic
