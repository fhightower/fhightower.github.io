# About Me...

I go by "Floyd". I'm a software craftsman dedicated to designing software and systems which make the world a better place.
I try to:

- Practice [Extreme Ownership](https://echelonfront.com/extreme-ownership/)
- Be humble enough to accept feedback and adopt a good idea
- Always be learning something new and pushing myself outside of my comfort zones

I hope you enjoy poking around this site and find it profitable, thought-provoking, and insightful.

Cheers,<br/>
Floyd
