## ~ Breakfast Menu ~

We design our menus with a "mix-and-match" philosophy - You order multiple, small items to create the breakfast that you want!

---
---

#### French Toast

This breakfast classic, made with our signature, cinnamon-raison Brioche bread, is sure to start your day off on the right foot.

Served with your choice of Peanut Butter, Maple Syrup (yes, it's the real deal), and/or Cherry Jam.

---

#### Yogurt and Maple-Almond Granola

Looking for something with a crunch and lots of protein? Yogurt with our maple-almond butter granola is a great option!

---

#### Granola

If you liked the last option, but want to replace the yogurt with Almond Milk, we can make that happen - just ask!

---

#### Toast

If you'd like some toast on the side of any order, we have whole-wheat and our signature, cinnamon-raison Brioche bread.

---

#### Eggs and Sausage

Simple. Hearty. Delicious! This plate includes eggs (cooked to your liking) and maple sausage. Certainly something to wake up for!

If you would like cheese added to your eggs, we *may* be able to accommodate this request if you ask nicely.
