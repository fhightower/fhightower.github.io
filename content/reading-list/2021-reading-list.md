Title | Author | Rating | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
*Gods and Robots: Myths, Machines, and Ancient Dreams of Technology* | Adrienne Mayor | C+ | Enjoyable read highlighting the history of machines and their interactions with man.
*Planet Narnia: The Seven Heavens in the Imagination of C. S. Lewis* | Michael Ward | A | Amazing work suggesting a compelling interpretive framework for *The Chronicles of Narnia*.
*The Horse and His Boy* | C. S. Lewis | A+ | One of my favorite of the Narniad
*King Solomon's Mines* | H. Rider Haggard | B | Fun, well-written adventure story
*Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative* | Edward R. Tufte | C | Interesting read with some helpful principles for good visual design. The discussion of the Challenger explosion is fascinating.
*The Elements of Style* | William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White | B | Very good read even for those who are not writers by trade or hobby.
*Talking God: Philosophers on Belief* | Gary Gutting | C | Good read introducing philosophical arguments for/against the existence of a God.
*The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It* | Peter Enns | D+ | Raises some good (and some poor) arguments against considering the Bible as a reliable source of information. My primary complaints are: (1) he does very little to prove any of his claims and (2) he seems very quick to listen to the claims of liberal scholars and slow to consider any conservative interpretation.
*The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable* | Nassim Nicholas Taleb | B+ | Very insightful and impactful book; a bit repetitive and, at times, rambling - but he raises some great points on the whole.
*Confessions* | Saint Augustine | A | One of the most worshipful books I have ever read. Highly recommended.
*Delighting in the Trinity: An Introduction to the Christian Faith* | Michael Reeves | A | Fantastic book!
*Common Rule: Habits of Purpose for an Age of Distraction* | Justin Earley | B | Great book
*Introduction to Algorithms (chapters 1 - 4)* | n/a | C | Read through the first four chapters with friends.
*Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder* | Nassim Nicholas Taleb | B+ | Fascinating read that has implications on numerous areas of life (engineering, programming, finance, politics)
*Common Sense; Addressed to the Inhabitants of America, on the Following Interesting Subjects.* | Thomas Paine | A | Very well-written treatise on the case for liberty of the thirteen colonies from Great Britain practically, politically, and theological
*The Great Debate: Advocates and Opponents of the American Constitution* | Thomas L. Pangle | B+ | Fantastic series of lectures investigating the debate between the Federalists and Antifederalists (and oft forgotten period of American history)
*Feeding the Mind* | Lewis Carrol | B | Fun, short read drawing analogies between the feeding of our physical bodies and that of the mind
*One to One Bible Reading* | David Helm | C | Interesting book highlighting the value of reading the bible with others (whether Christian or not)
*Knowledge and Christian Belief* | Alvin Plantinga | B+ | Great introduction to Epistemology as it relates to Christian Belief showing the Christian belief can be rational (having warrant and proper function)
*Loaded: A Disarming History of the Second Amendment* | Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz | C | Insightful history of gun rights, gun control, and gun ownership in America (primarily noting the racial and ethnic abuse that necessitated the use of guns)
*More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws* | John R. Lott Jr. | C+ | Insightful work presenting numerous statistics showing, as the title implies, that the more guns possessed by private citizens, the less crime is likely to occur in a given area
*Masterpieces of the Imaginative Mind: Literature's Most Fantastic Work* | Eric S. Rabkin | B+ | Fascinating foray into literature of the past 4-500 years
*Time Machine: An Invention* | H. G. Wells | B+ | Fascinating and fun science fiction story which introduces the idea of time travel and contains some fascinating political commentary
*The Island of Doctor Moreau* | H. G. Wells | B+ | Gruesome and violent read full of commentary and analysis on the nature of man vs. animals, the role of science, and the role of religion/tradition in a society
*War of the Worlds* | H. G. Wells | C+ | Fun, imaginative read which does a fantastic job of describing how human society would respond to a sudden invasion - not as good as his other works, though
*Out of the Silent Planet* | C. S. Lewis | B+ | Amazing work of science fiction (which certainly is influenced by and is a spin on H. G. Wells' *War of the Worlds*) pondering the interaction of a fallen man with unfallen creatures on Malacandra
*The Abolition of Man* | C. S. Lewis | B | An amazing work critiquing moral subjectivism - I think he is, at times, oversimplifying his opponents' views and oversimplifying the evidence in favor of his own, but still think it is a thought-provoking read
*A Gospel Primer for Christians: Learning to See the Glories of God's Love* | Milton Vincent | B | Very good work celebrating (and encouraging us to daily celebrate), in various forms and genres, the beauty of God the Father's love for us as shown in the Son, Jesus Christ, and mediated by the Holy Spirit.
*From the Earth to the Moon* | Jules Verne | C | Mild interesting story in Verne's style
*Amazing Grace in the Life of William Wilberforce* | John Piper | B | Fascinating biography of a wonderful man who fought to end the slave trade and slavery in England
