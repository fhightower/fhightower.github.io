† Note on the "Redrawing the Line Between Hermeneutics and Application" article:

> I could certainly be wrong, but this article's lament that the New Hermeneutic has "[incorporated] the step of application into the hermeneutical process"<sup>1</sup> seems to contradict Article IX of the [Chicago Statement on Biblical Hermeneutics](https://library.dts.edu/Pages/TL/Special/ICBI_2.pdf) which says:

> > "We affirm that the term hermeneutics, which historically signified the rules of exegesis, may properly be extended to cover all that is involved in the process of perceiving what the biblical revelation means and how it bears on our lives."
