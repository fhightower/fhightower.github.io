- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Greece">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Greece</a> - Fascinating because of the supposed connection with the phrase "Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος"
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bikini_Atoll">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bikini_Atoll</a> - Fascinating historical significance behind this flag
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bangladesh">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bangladesh</a> - Fascinating because the central circle is off-centered so that it appears in the middle when flying from a pole/mast
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehuelche_people#/media/File:Bandiera_tehuelche.jpg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehuelche_people#/media/File:Bandiera_tehuelche.jpg</a> - This one is just oddly laid out. I like it as it is very unusual and eye-catching.
