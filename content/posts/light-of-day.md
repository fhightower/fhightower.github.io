It is a deeply held principle of mine that beliefs and ideas are strongest when they have been tested and exposed to the proverbial 'light of day'. We have a tendency to cloister our beliefs and new ideas within the comfortable walls of our own minds. When we do this, we are missing out on the criticism, critique, and dialog that makes ideas powerful and robust.

Ideas which are not exposed to the real world are like a cardboard box; they can withstand minimal pressure from certain directions, but are not ready to hold up the weight of careful scrutiny. Powerful, world-changing ideas are like gold or diamonds; they are formed by strenuous, uncomfortable processes over time. This is why I try to expose my ideas to the light of day rather than keeping them hidden in my mind. I want to think powerful, world-changing thoughts and I can't do that on my own.
