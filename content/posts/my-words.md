The words we use open doors for us to think new thoughts. Personally, I agree with a weak hypothesis branch of the [Sapirâ€“Whorf hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) as supported by the "[Russian blues](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/19/7780)" experiment. Because I believe that words are powerful and I have noticed that our language does not have words for some ideas and things I would like to articulate, I have invented (sometimes stolen from other languages) the following words:

### Lachem

*Noun, the "ch" is a gutteral as in the word "loch"*: A member of a set whose name and/or characteristics (usually just the name) has come to described the whole set. For example, Kleenexes are a lachem because Kleenex is just one member of the set of all facial tissue brands, yet the name has come to characterize the entire set of facial tissues.

### Lamech

*Noun, the "ch" is a gutteral as in the word "loch"*: A member of a set to which the parent set is viewed as having shrunk. An example is the term ['UI'](/thoughts/gui-vs-ui/).

### Machem

*Noun, the "ch" is a gutteral as in the word "loch"*:  A member of a set which is viewed as being distinct from its parent set. For example, malware is a subset of computer programs, but malware is often viewed by the general public as distinct from 'normal' computer programs. Therefore, malware could be called a machem.

### Suvia

*Noun*: A journey or travel in the rain.

### Solvia

*Noun*: A journey or travel in the direction of the sun (usually the setting sun).

### Parea

*Noun*: Has the same meaning as the Greek word from which it is transliterated: a group of friends who gather to enjoy nothing else but sharing their life experiences, philosophies, values, and ideas.

### Egan

*Noun*: One of your ideas which you find has already been described, accomplished, or articulated by someone else.

*Verb*: The act performed when someone describes, accomplishes, or articulates an idea that you had. For example, "She is going to *egan* someone." and "I have been *eganed*!".

### Nage

*Noun, pronounced with a soft 'g'*: The feeling when you realize that one of your ideas is an egan (see the two words above). This sensation is simultaneously an honor (because you had a good idea) and a disappointment (because the egan is already taken).

### Wouldings

*Noun*: This word, invented by [Jonathan Edwards](/tags/jonathan-edwards), refers to "very weak inclinations which do not represent genuine convictions and do not issue in action"<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

### Bundling

*Verb*: The action performed when one wears clothing appropriate for the weather you would *like* to have rather than the weather you actually have.
