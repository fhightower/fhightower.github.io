The cycle is this:

1. **F**ind - Identify everything that needs to be done
1. **F**ocus - Prioritize the tasks, focussing on the most important
1. **F**inish (or **F**ix if it's more appropriate) - Do the work to finish (or fix) the task
1. **F**eedback - Get feedback about the work you did and learn from it
1. (Return either to step 1 or 2)

The cycle is iterative. From the last step, you can either go to step 1 and re-identify everything that needs to be done (useful in dynamic environments where the set of tasks is constantly changing) or go to step 2 and re-prioritize the tasks (useful if the set of tasks is unlikely to have changed substantially).

The '4F cycle' is helpful for planning and executing work. It is a simple way to ensure that you are doing the right work and that you are doing the work right.
