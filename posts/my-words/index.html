<a class=link href=https://hightower.space/tags/definitions>#Definitions</a></div><article class=content><p>The words we use open doors for us to think new thoughts. Personally, I agree with a weak hypothesis branch of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity>Sapir–Whorf hypothesis</a> as supported by the &ldquo;<a href=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/19/7780>Russian blues</a>&rdquo; experiment. Because I believe that words are powerful and I have noticed that our language does not have words for some ideas and things I would like to articulate, I have invented (sometimes stolen from other languages) the following words:</p><h2 id=lachem>Lachem</h2><p><em>Noun, the &ldquo;ch&rdquo; is a gutteral as in the word &ldquo;loch&rdquo;</em>: A member of a set whose name and/or characteristics (usually just the name) has come to described the whole set. For example, Kleenexes are a lachem because Kleenex is just one member of the set of all facial tissue brands, yet the name has come to characterize the entire set of facial tissues.</p><h2 id=lamech>Lamech</h2><p><em>Noun, the &ldquo;ch&rdquo; is a gutteral as in the word &ldquo;loch&rdquo;</em>: A member of a set to which the parent set is viewed as having shrunk. An example is the term <a href=/thoughts/gui-vs-ui/>&lsquo;UI&rsquo;</a>.</p><h2 id=machem>Machem</h2><p><em>Noun, the &ldquo;ch&rdquo; is a gutteral as in the word &ldquo;loch&rdquo;</em>: A member of a set which is viewed as being distinct from its parent set. For example, malware is a subset of computer programs, but malware is often viewed by the general public as distinct from &rsquo;normal&rsquo; computer programs. Therefore, malware could be called a machem.</p><h2 id=suvia>Suvia</h2><p><em>Noun</em>: A journey or travel in the rain.</p><h2 id=solvia>Solvia</h2><p><em>Noun</em>: A journey or travel in the direction of the sun (usually the setting sun).</p><h2 id=parea>Parea</h2><p><em>Noun</em>: Has the same meaning as the Greek word from which it is transliterated: a group of friends who gather to enjoy nothing else but sharing their life experiences, philosophies, values, and ideas.</p><h2 id=egan>Egan</h2><p><em>Noun</em>: One of your ideas which you find has already been described, accomplished, or articulated by someone else.</p><p><em>Verb</em>: The act performed when someone describes, accomplishes, or articulates an idea that you had. For example, &ldquo;She is going to <em>egan</em> someone.&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have been <em>eganed</em>!&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=nage>Nage</h2><p><em>Noun, pronounced with a soft &lsquo;g&rsquo;</em>: The feeling when you realize that one of your ideas is an egan (see the two words above). This sensation is simultaneously an honor (because you had a good idea) and a disappointment (because the egan is already taken).</p><h2 id=wouldings>Wouldings</h2><p><em>Noun</em>: This word, invented by <a href=/tags/jonathan-edwards>Jonathan Edwards</a>, refers to &ldquo;very weak inclinations which do not represent genuine convictions and do not issue in action&rdquo;<sup><a href=#footnote1>1</a></sup></p><h2 id=bundling>Bundling</h2><p><em>Verb</em>: The action performed when one wears clothing appropriate for the weather you would <em>like</em> to have rather than the weather you actually have.</p><h2 id=strofe>Strofe</h2><p><em>Noun</em>: Derived from &ldquo;<strong>str</strong>anger <strong>o</strong>n road <strong>f</strong>requently <strong>e</strong>ncountered&rdquo; refers to a stranger that you keep seeing while traveling.</p><h2 id=notes>Notes</h2><p><a id=footnote1>1. </a>This quotation is taken from footnote #2 here: Edwards, Jonathan, Perry Miller, John E. Smith, and Harry S. Stout. <em>The Works of Jonathan Edwards. Religious Affections</em>. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1966, 99.</p></article><div class=paginator><a class=link href=https://hightower.space/posts/great-things-take-time/>← prev</a>
