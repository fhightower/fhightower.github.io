This is a post in a series recording some notes as I&rsquo;m studying for Google&rsquo;s Professional Data Engineer Certification.
In this post, I provide some common recipies which are commonly used in Google Cloud.

GCP PDE Recipies
The Classic
Pub/Sub -> Dataflow -> BQ (batch inserts)
Variations:

Pub/Sub -> Dataflow -> BQ (streaming inserts)
Pub/Sub -> Dataflow -> Bigtable -> BQ (querying Bigtable using federated query)

For use-cases which require analytics and the low-latency afforded by Bigtable



Uploading Data to Google Cloud

gsutil

on-prem. (if practical based on network bandwidth and data size)
Good for < 1TB


Storage Transfer Service

From another cloud/on-prem. data center w/ sufficient bandwidth
Good for > 1TB


Transfer Appliance

Physical hard-drive you fill and send back
For large amounts of data on-prem. and/or in a low-bandwidth location which makes gsutil impractical
