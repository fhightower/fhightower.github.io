<a class=link href=https://hightower.space/tags/podcasts>#Podcasts</a></div><article class=content><section>Books read in 2022: 60<ol><li><details><summary><i>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</i> [A]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>J. R. Tolkien</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>I enjoy this series more and more each time I read it.</li><li>This time, I noticed how the adventure begins right in Hobbiton as Frodo is almost caught on a number of occasions. The movies scale the danger as the adventure goes on, but the books introduce the danger right from the start</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High</i> [B+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Joseph Grenny</li><li>Ron McMillan</li><li>Al Switzler</li><li>Kerry Patterson</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>I think this book is a &lsquo;must-read&rsquo; for everyone and worth reading regularly. It provides so many practical, helpful tips applicable to relationships with a spouse, family, friends, co-workers, and bosses</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Live Not by Lies: A Manual for Christian Dissidents</i> [B]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Rod Dreher</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Worth reading&mldr; forecasts concerning trends in today&rsquo;s culture and provides practical steps (not the least of which is to &rsquo;live not by lies&rsquo;) to live a Christian in this culture</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win</i> [A+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Jocko Willink</li><li>Leif Babin</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Absolutely fantastic read. A rare book I will read yearly.</li><li>Very challenging book that rips out the heart of excuses and apathy.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Redeeming Mathematics: A God-Centered Approach</i> [C]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Vern S. Poythress</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Mildly interesting</li><li>At times, the arguments seem overly simple, obvious, or forced. For example, the author argues that our ability to extrapolate natural numbers to infinity shows how we are thinking God&rsquo;s thoughts after Him and imitating (in a small way) God&rsquo;s infinitude. While this may be true, I don&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> the weight/value of this argument.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Trivium: The Classical Liberal Arts of Grammar, Logic, & Rhetoric</i> [C+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>many...</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Fun and informative read, providing a number of basic constructs and principles in grammar, logic, and rhetoric.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn</i> [C+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Richard W. Hamming</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Fascinating read on multiple levels: historically (as it describes the development of a number of computer technologies), mathematically, technologically, and philosophically.</li><li>Good read although a bit dry or wandering at times</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Math Without Numbers</i> [C+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Milo Beckman</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Very fun and informative read. Does a great job of communicating the vastness, themes, and beauty of mathematics.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Husband-Coached Childbirth: The Bradley Method of Natural Childbirth</i> [C]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Robert A. Bradley</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>This was clearly written at a very different time (e.g. a time when husbands couldn&rsquo;t be in the room w/ their wives)</li><li>Good prep. material for husbands to understand what their wives will go through and how to support them</li><li>While I&rsquo;m certainly not an expert, he seems to be overstating the ease of unmedicated childbirth</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Show Them No Mercy: 4 Views on God and Canaanite Genocide</i> [B]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>C. S. Cowles</li><li>Daniel L. Gard</li><li>Eugene H. Merrill</li><li>Tremper Longman III</li><li>Stanley N. Gundry (Editor)</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>I felt all positions were very clearly articulated</li><li>My agreement w/ the various views (from greatest to least) is: 1. Spiritual Continuity, 2. Moderate Discontinuity, 3. Eschatological Continuity, 4. Strong Discontinuity</li><li>I was particularly interested by C. S. Cowles argument and responses. His response to Tremper Longman was interesting in that he seemed (like Job&rsquo;s friends) to be saying &lsquo;The book of Revelation is complicated&mldr; here&rsquo;s what it means&mldr;&rsquo;. Additionally, his quotation of Exodus 34:6-7 (pg. 195) was interesting b/c he cut the quotation short so that it didn&rsquo;t include God&rsquo;s promise to punish the guilty and punish evil-doers and their children.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Enlightening Symbols: A Short History of Mathematical Notation and Its Hidden Powers</i> [C-]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Joseph Mazur</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Not as fascinating as I expected, but some interesting historical points</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Work</i> [B]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Daniel M. Doriani</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>As stated in the conclusion of this book: &lsquo;[T]his book has argued that we can hope to effect live-giving social reforms through work&rsquo;</li><li>As stated in the conclusion of this book: &lsquo;This book maintains that despite human sin, the cultural mandate&mldr; still stands. We dare to think that Christians can do more than making a living or avoiding sin. We show that Christ, the King, has come and that His kingdom has arrived, even in our work, in every realm of life.&rsquo;</li><li>Very good read that addresses some foundational questions about work from a historical, theological, and biblical approach</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>The Death of Porn: Men of Integrity Building a World of Nobility</i> [C]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Ray Ortlund</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Decent book serving as a call to action for men to reject the culture of Porn and the objectification of women.</li><li>Simple, short. Not earth-shaking, but encouraging and worth reading</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Four Views on Free Will</i> [C]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>John Martin Fischer</li><li>Robert Kane</li><li>Derk Pereboom</li><li>Manuel Vargas</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Very informative introduction - the intro alone is worth reading as it sets the stage for this fascinating topic</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Theology and Sanity</i> [A]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Frank Sheed</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>One of the best theology books I&rsquo;ve read - it addresses pertinent, enlightening, and awe-inspiring topics usually neglected by theology books I&rsquo;ve read</li><li>Even as a Protestant, I find this book fascinating and insightful</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the Ring</i> [A]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>J. R. Tolkien</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Fantastic conclusion to the trilogy</li><li>Even better than the movie</li><li>Gets better every time I read it</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America&rsquo;s Wealthy</i> [B]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Thomas J.

Thus, many farmers are proactively &lsquo;helping&rsquo; tree species move (called &lsquo;assisted migration&rsquo;).</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Fragments of Infinity: A Kaleidoscope of Math and Art</i> [10]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Ivars Peterson</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Good read, one with many inspirations for mathematicians and artists</li><li>Good source for names of mathematicians/artists</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Beautiful Geometry</i> [10]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Eli Maor</li><li>Eugen Jost</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Fun read w/ a number of interesting art works throughout the book to illustrate the concepts being discussed</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i><a href=https://thebahnsengroup.com/dividend-cafe/>Dividend Cafe</a></i> [1]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>David L.

Bahnsen</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Good intro to presuppositional apologetics</li><li>Before reading this book, I would not have considered myself a presuppositional apologist, but after reading it I now do</li><li>When claiming that one of the steps of the apologist is to demonstrate internal inconsistencies in other world-views, his entire argument relies on the KJV translation of 2 Tim. 2:25&mldr; other translations translate this passage in way that does not support his conclusion</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Dune</i> [10]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Frank Herbert</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>It is hard for me to say too many good things about this book&mldr; this is great science fiction; it strikes the perfect balance of futuristic and exotic with relatable and clear</li><li>My one negative critique is that there are scenes which jump significant amounts of time without warning and sometimes leave the reader (at least me) with a sense of &lsquo;whiplash&rsquo;. I would have appreciated smoother transitions at a few points.</li><li>I really appreciated the complexity of the world he created.

Although I think some points are a stretch, I think the overall argument is compelling (although I have not read any academic responses to Mr. Menzies&rsquo; argument).</li><li>One recurring argument of particular interest was the argument that some distortions and errors on early maps can be explained by considering that early explorers were just viewing land from a ship a sea (sometimes are great distances) and, at certain latitudes, would have a hard time finding their longitude (a challenge he discusses at length in the book).</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>The Wingfeather Saga: On the Edge of the Dark Sea of Darkness</i> [10]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Andrew Peterson</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Fantastic story (for both kids and adults) that we are excited to share with friends and family.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Eating on the Wild Side: The Missing Link to Optimum Health</i> [1]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li></li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Great reference book - I don&rsquo;t recommend reading cover-to-cover (unless you want to, of course), but the intro is helpful and specific chapters may be particularly relevant to your location and diet</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Leadership Strategy and Tactics: Field Manual</i> [10]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Jocko Willink</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Good book - fleshes out and clarifies a lot of what is discussed in Extreme Ownership</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>The Case for Dividend Growth: Investing in a Post-Crisis World</i> [1]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>David L.
