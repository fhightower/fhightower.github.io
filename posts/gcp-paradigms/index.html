Typically, this is done by applying a ETL step to the data in a data lake.</p><p>Data lakes and warehouses often fit together like:</p><p>[Raw data] -replicated-> [Data lake] -ETL-> [Data Warehouse]</p><p><strong>Databases</strong>, like data warehouses and unlike data lakes, store structured data. Unlike data warehouses, they are optimized
for writes and often use record/row-based storage. Data is databases is typically live rather than populated from somewhere else.</p><h3 id=el-elt-and-etl>EL, ELT, and ETL</h3><p>These are three methods to consider when moving data from a source into a target GCP system.
The correct method is determined by how much transformation is required to get the data into the desired state.
The methods below are listed from lesser to greater transformation required:</p><ul><li>EL - Extract and Load: Extract data from source and load data as-is into target system</li><li>ELT - Extract, Load, and Transform: Extract data from source, load into target system, transform in the target system</li><li>ETL - Extract, Transform, and Load: Extract data from source, transform data, load data into target system</li></ul><p>In an ETL pipeline, it is important to:</p><ul><li>Maintain data lineage</li><li>Keep metadata</li><li>Data Catalog is a GCP product to help discover and manage metadata</li></ul><h3 id=others>Others</h3><p>Here are some others which I&rsquo;m not going to discuss here:</p><ul><li>push vs. pull events</li><li>3 v&rsquo;s of data: variety, volume, velocity</li><li>seperation of compute and storage</li></ul></article><div class=paginator><a class=link href=https://hightower.space/posts/pubsub-notes/>← prev</a>
