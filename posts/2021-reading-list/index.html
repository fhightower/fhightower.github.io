Interesting to hear the complaints in their own words and fascinating how much John Calvin quotes from the church fathers.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Little Book on the Christian Life</i> [B]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>John Calvin</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Very good book. Recommended for Christians.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Five Red Herrings</i> [B]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Dorothy L.

Enjoyed this one more than some of the others.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Desiring the Kingdom: Worship, Worldview, and Cultural Formation (Cultural Liturgies)</i> [A]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>James K. A. Smith</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Fantastic read highly recommended for Christian scholars. He, appropriately I believe, addresses the overly rationalistic mentality that is common in the conservative, evangelical church today. I appreciate his focus on the value and import of daily, &lsquo;common&rsquo; practices (read &rsquo;liturgies&rsquo;) that are shaping us.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>NutureShock: New Thinking About Children</i> [B]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Po Bronson</li><li>Ashley Merryman</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Insightful book providing recent research about raising children.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Last Days According to Jesus</i> [B+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>R.

He does a better job than anybody I know at communicating nuance and complexity of things like the covid vaccine and whether or not masks do anything helpful. If there&rsquo;s one thing you take away from this list, it&rsquo;s to read some C. S. Lewis. Second to that is listen to this podcast :)</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Civilization and Its Discontents</i> [C]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Sigmund Freud</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Sometimes thinkers appeal to what they perceive is a general consensus to prove their point which I do not share. I find Freud does this a bit. I agree with Freud&rsquo;s own comments late in the book viz that the work is, at times rambling. Perhaps I lack the taste necessary to appreciate Freud or maybe this is not one of his great works, but I found it disappointing for someone so highly regarded and oft cited as Freud.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>No-Drama Discipline: The Whole-Brain Way to Calm the Chaos and Nurture Your Child&rsquo;s Developing Mind</i> [C+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Daniel J. J. Siegel</li><li>Tina Payne Bryson</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Good book w/ helpful principles for disciplining children. I appreciate the emphasis on <strong>connecting</strong> with kids and <strong>redirecting</strong> them toward better behaviours rather than flying off the handle in spur-of-the-moment frustration.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Expecting Better: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom Is Wrong&ndash;and What You Really Need to Know</i> [A+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Emily Oster</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Valuable book applying an evidence-driven approach to conception, pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Very informative and thorough in both depth and breadth.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave</i> [A]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Frederick Douglass</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>This is an powerful and compelling narrative describing the horrors and inner workings of slavery. Also, a powerful indictment of the kind of religion which was complicit in slavery.</li><li>I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of the land&mldr; The dealers in the bodies of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit, and they mutually help each other. The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his infernal business with the garb of Christianity. Here we have religion and robbery the allies of each other—devils dressed in angels’ robes, and hell presenting the semblance of paradise.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions</i> [B]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Edwin Abbott</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Funny and fascinating read. It is funny as a critique and commentary of Abbott&rsquo;s victorian society and fascinating to consider what a two dimensional world would be like and the complexities of moving from one dimension to another in either reality or imagination.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>He Saw That It Was Good: Reimagining Your Creative Life to Repair a Broken World</i> [C+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Sho Baraka</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>I still do not know what I think this book. I recommend it and there is some great, thought provoking content therein. I am saddened and confused by an attitude in the book that seems to say (and I sincerely hope I&rsquo;m not misrepresenting the book) that Christians of different ethnicities should be separate so they don&rsquo;t lose their cultural identities and creative resources. While I whole-heartedly support the preservation of cultural identities and creative resources, I also believe that a Church can be ethnically and culturally diverse without eclipsing many of the constituent ethnicities (although, I grant, this is rarely accomplished). I could have misunderstood Sho Baraka, but I understood him as advocating for christians of different ethnicies to remain relatively distinct and I do not see that as a desirable goal.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse</i> [A+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Charlie Mackesy</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>&ldquo;What do you want to be when you grow up?&rdquo; &ldquo;Kind&rdquo; said the boy.</li></ul>Private Notes:<ul><li>6065,2419,4748,1988,1627,35,3613,4382,2549,4732,3907,84,3010,5785,1134,2844,1853,1849,3996,2162,1325,1551,1051,4316,2616,689,5218,4342,3987,4352,2329,3181,3570,3874,4874,5119,5957,372,5731,5414,5650,3798,4857,5948,3604,2669,1673,1293,5530,4801,1014,2975,5321,1922,4807,1005,2965,3538,2785,4112,2499,5901,3178,2600,470,943,2457,5448,5799,2021,2784,5640,4274,3826,127,80,2237,5396,4464,2361,4462,2143,5684,1375,2793,897,2443,141,5530,332,5255,5765,5684,1739,443,4275,6104,6097</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Replacing Darwin: The New Origin of Species</i> [C+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Nathaniel T Jeanson</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Interesting book. The first bit (half?) is introductory biology and genetics (both history and theory). The second half of the book makes the argument that speciation occurs rather rapidly (one new species every couple of years) and that &ldquo;shifts from heterozygosity to homozygosity are the major genetic mechanism of speciation&rdquo;.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth</i> [C+]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Edward O. Wilson</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Good book, written by a secular humanist scientist to a hypothetical pastor, presenting the case for preserving the created world. As the author expresses, I find it fascinating that Christians who believe God created the world have bought into political ideologies (the current, Republican mantra) which treats our planet with very little dignity.</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>The Most Beautiful Mathematical Formulas: An Entertaining Look at the Most Insightful, Useful, and Quirky Theorems of All Time</i> [B]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Lionel Salem</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Fun book to read with some fascinating mathematical principles and formulas.</li></ul>Private Notes:<ul><li>5550,862,707,4731,1715,803,5084,5535,4931,1508,1161,473,5361,2264,4030,5021,5443,4609,5359,5912,2521,2625,5103,4884,5155,5244,1005,5979,3953,924,3794,2449,567,3869,1512,817,3840,4622,3340,519,4149,146,143,442,798,1789,14,4276,3226,5215,2872</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Better Left Unsaid</i> [B]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Curt Jaimungal</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Pertinent and poignant analysis of what&rsquo;s going on in America today and the bifurcation of discourse in America.</li></ul>Private Notes:<ul><li>4658,29,5430,5450,4170,2429,1137,2415,2890,2380,2855,4102,2816,3573,339,2991,442,5198,4085,1697,878,247,2308,3845,3932,3546,2638,1129,5370,460,3173,524,2617,5171,187,3695,127,1892,5300,2098,2582,1877,2893,2088,5246,932,4259,2811,832,4887,3674,3255,1207,4896,2266,3861,3265,3963,2040,1817,1280,5350,2044,4792,116,3257,1848,4292,5818,3951,3549,2639,95,2761,3072,3385,3330,5727</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Flowers for Lisa: A Delirium of Photographic Invention</i> [B]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Abelardo Morell</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Beautiful collection of creative and imaginative photos!</li></ul><br></details></li><li><details><summary><i>Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation</i> [C]</summary>Author(s):<ul><li>Bill Nye</li></ul>Notes:<ul><li>Neither Bill Nye nor Ken Ham (a creationist Bill Nye debated which prompted this book) are very nuanced in their views and they both overstate their position. For example, Bill overstates the advantage and evolutionary world-view holds over a creationist view with respect to the joy of discovery and exploring the world around us. Both the evolutionist and creationist can passionately explore the world around us. Bill does raise some good objections to Ken Ham&rsquo;s distinction between &lsquo;historic&rsquo; science and &lsquo;present&rsquo; science (as he did in the debate). I will say, Bill Nye&rsquo;s rebuttle to the creationist objection that evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics by requiring that order come from energy released in a closed system was very poor. He objects that earth is <em>not</em> a closed system because it gets energy from the universe around it. This ignores the fact that the argument still works if one just expands the objection to the universe. In other words: granted that the earth isn&rsquo;t a closed system, but the <em>universe</em> is, so the same problem applies.
